#### About
Hey, I'm Zoreslav. I'm a mobile software engineer with over a decade of experience building and shipping top quality apps for Apple platforms. 

Before making app development my speciality, I've been involved in game development, [innovative 3D tech](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/mydeco), full stack web development, and at some point led a software team responsible for creating [Interpol e-Passport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpol_Travel_Document) manufacturing software.

Lately I've been using Swift and SwiftUI most of the time, and I certainly enjoy having modern Swift concurrency and Combine at hand. However, the majority of the apps I worked on, were made with UIKit, Foundation and GCD. I think that the best app architecture is the one every team member fully understands and is able to consistently utilize. That being said, in my opinion [Clean Architecture](https://nalexn.github.io/clean-architecture-swiftui/) and [The Composable Architecture](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture) are among the better choices.

I tend to prioritize the end user experience over development speed or code elegance, both of which I deem highly valuable nonetheless. I believe in apps that [make our hearts sing](https://daringfireball.net/2023/02/making_our_hearts_sing).
