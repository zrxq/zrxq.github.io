#### About

Hey, I'm Zoreslav. I am a mobile software engineer with over a decade of experience building and shipping quality apps for Apple devices.

Before making mobile apps my specialty, I have been doing game development, [innovative 3D tech](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/mydeco), and full-stack web. At some point, I led a software team responsible for creating [Interpol e-Passport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpol_Travel_Document) manufacturing software.

Lately, I have been using Swift and SwiftUI most of the time, and I certainly enjoy having modern Swift concurrency and Combine at hand. However, most of the apps I have worked on before were made with UIKit, Foundation, and GCD. I think that the best app architecture is the one all team members fully understand and can consistently utilize. That being said, to my mind [Clean Architecture](https://nalexn.github.io/clean-architecture-swiftui/) and [The Composable Architecture](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture) are among the better choices. 

I prefer to prioritize the resulting user experience over development speed, where possible. I believe in creating apps that [make our hearts sing](https://daringfireball.net/2023/02/making_our_hearts_sing).
