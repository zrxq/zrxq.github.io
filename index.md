#### About

Hey, I'm Zoreslav. I specialize in developing high-quality iOS apps and have over a decade of experience building and shipping apps for Apple devices.

Before specializing in mobile app development, I worked on game development, [innovative 3D tech](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/mydeco), and full-stack web. At some point, I led a software team responsible for creating [Interpol e-Passport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpol_Travel_Document) manufacturing software.

Lately, I have been using **Swift** and **SwiftUI** most of the time, and I enjoy having modern Swift concurrency and **Combine** at hand. However, the majority of my previous app development experience involved using **UIKit**, **Foundation**, and **GCD**. I think that the best app architecture is one that all team members can understand and utilize consistently. That being said, I think [Clean Architecture](https://nalexn.github.io/clean-architecture-swiftui/) and [The Composable Architecture](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture) are among the better choices. 

My interest in mobile app development originates from my belief in better life through technology. Mobile technology is already deeply integrated into human lives and the quality of user experience in mobile apps we use directly affects our well-being. That's why I believe it's our responsibility, as developers, to always strive for an intuitive, smooth, rewarding and empowering experience that our users deserve.
